##  Git local repository concepts  ##
##---------------------------------------
## login to the system where you have installed git and created your 1st repo as per the previous blog post
## Go inside mygit directory
cd mygit
## Create a file named file1 (file will be created in working tree)
echo "name: debjeet" > file1 && echo "fav color: blue" >> file1

## Check git status > one untracked file found
git status

## Add the file to git index (file will be added to staging area)
git add file1

## Check git status > file is added to git index and is ready for commite
git status

## Before commit you can add your user name and email to git config
git config --local user.name "Debjeet" && \
git config --local user.email "debjeet@cloudaffaire.com"

## View git config
git config --list #git config is stored in config file inside .git directory
cat .git/config

## You can edit your git config file using git config --local --edit or vi .git/config

## Commit the file (file will be added to local repository)
git commit -m "file1 added"

## Check git log
git log

## Check git status > file is consistent across working tree, staging area and local repo
git status

## Edit file1 and change fav color to green(will be edited in working tree)
vi file1
------------
name: debjeet
fav color: green
------------
:wq

## Check git status > changes are not added to staging area yet
git status

## Get difference between staging area in working tree (blue is changed to green)
git diff

## Get difference between local repository and staging (no difference as we have not staged the changes yet)
git diff --staged

## Stage the changes (now our working tree and staging area has same data)
git add file1

## Check git status > changes are ready to be committed
git status

## Difference between working tree and staging (since we already staged by git add, no difference)
git diff

## Difference between the staging area and local repository (not same as we have not committed yet)
git diff --staged

## Commit the file (file will be added to the local repository)
git commit -m "file1 edited"

## File will be consistent in all three space
git diff
git diff --staged
git status

## Check the log
git log --oneline

## If you want to check what changed in local repository
git log -p
